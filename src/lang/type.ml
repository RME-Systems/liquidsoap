(* Type information comes attached to the AST from the parsing,
 * with appropriate sharing of the type variables. Then the type inference
 * performs in-place unification.
 *
 * In order to report precise type error messages, we put very dense
 * parsing location information in the type. Every layer of it can have
 * a location. Destructive unification introduces links in such a way
 * that the old location is still accessible.
 *
 * The level annotation represents the number of abstractions which surround
 * the type in the AST -- function arguments and let-in definitions.
 * It is used to safely generalize types.
 *
 * Finally, constraints can be attached to existential (unknown, '_a)
 * and universal ('a) type variables. *)
